Algorithm Analysis:
Big Omega (asymptotic lower bound) - a function will take at least this much to run (best case scenario);

Big O (asymptotic upper bound) - the function will take no more than this much to run (worst case scenario);

Big Theta (asymptotically tight bound) - the function will take exactly that much to run, no matter what input we give.
