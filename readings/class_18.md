## Cryptography

[Crash Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)

In _**substitution cipher**_ each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

        Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
        Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.

        Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
        Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
